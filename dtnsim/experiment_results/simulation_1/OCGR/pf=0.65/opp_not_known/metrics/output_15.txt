The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
208(10 to 6), 223(1 to 11), 227(1 to 6), 228(5 to 10), 257(4 to 1), 259(9 to 12), 274(3 to 9), 303(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(274: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(208: 1), (223: 2), (227: 1), (228: 5), (257: 2), (259: 4), (274: 6), (303: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
