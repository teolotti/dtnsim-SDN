The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1825(10 to 6), 1842(1 to 11), 1845(1 to 6), 1846(5 to 10), 1874(4 to 1), 1875(9 to 12), 1892(3 to 9), 1923(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1875: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1825: 3), (1842: 2), (1845: 1), (1846: 4), (1874: 4), (1875: 4), (1892: 2), (1923: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 37 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
