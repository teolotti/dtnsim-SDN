The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1380(10 to 6), 1395(1 to 11), 1398(1 to 6), 1399(5 to 10), 1428(4 to 1), 1429(9 to 12), 1450(3 to 9), 1480(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1429: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1380: 1), (1395: 2), (1398: 1), (1399: 4), (1428: 4), (1429: 3), (1450: 2), (1480: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 32 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
