The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
613(10 to 6), 628(1 to 11), 632(1 to 6), 633(5 to 10), 661(4 to 1), 666(9 to 12), 682(3 to 9), 715(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(632: 15.000000), (715: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(613: 4), (628: 3), (632: 3), (633: 5), (661: 2), (666: 4), (682: 2), (715: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 42 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
