The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
65(10 to 6), 68(1 to 11), 72(1 to 6), 73(5 to 10), 76(4 to 1), 79(9 to 12), 81(3 to 9), 84(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(65: 1), (68: 3), (72: 3), (73: 1), (76: 1), (79: 1), (81: 2), (84: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 21 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 68: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 72: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 68: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 72: (to: 6, time: 60.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Bundle 81: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 76: (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 73: (to: 4, time: 30.000000), 
Node 6:
