The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1011(10 to 6), 1014(1 to 11), 1017(1 to 6), 1018(5 to 10), 1035(4 to 1), 1036(9 to 12), 1045(3 to 9), 1063(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1036: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1011: 1), (1014: 2), (1017: 1), (1018: 4), (1035: 4), (1036: 3), (1045: 2), (1063: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 1014: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
