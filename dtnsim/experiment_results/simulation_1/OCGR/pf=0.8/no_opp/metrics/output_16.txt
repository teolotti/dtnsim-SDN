The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
134(10 to 6), 135(1 to 11), 136(1 to 6), 137(5 to 10), 138(4 to 1), 139(9 to 12), 141(3 to 9), 145(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(134: 1), (135: 2), (136: 1), (137: 1), (138: 2), (139: 1), (141: 2), (145: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 19 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 135: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Bundle 136: (to: 3, time: 50.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 141: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), (to: 6, time: 100.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 138: (to: 5, time: 70.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 137: (to: 4, time: 30.000000), 
Bundle 138: (to: 12, time: 110.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Bundle 139: (to: 8, time: 50.000000), 
Node 10:
