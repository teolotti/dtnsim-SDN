The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
286(10 to 6), 287(1 to 11), 291(1 to 6), 292(5 to 10), 295(4 to 1), 296(9 to 12), 299(3 to 9), 303(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(286: 1), (287: 2), (291: 1), (292: 2), (295: 4), (296: 1), (299: 2), (303: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
