The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
205(10 to 6), 219(1 to 11), 224(1 to 6), 225(5 to 10), 251(4 to 1), 252(9 to 12), 271(3 to 9), 301(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(225: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(205: 1), (219: 2), (224: 1), (225: 3), (251: 4), (252: 4), (271: 2), (301: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
