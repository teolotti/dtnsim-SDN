The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
958(10 to 6), 972(1 to 11), 975(1 to 6), 976(5 to 10), 1004(4 to 1), 1005(9 to 12), 1022(3 to 9), 1050(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(958: 1), (972: 2), (975: 1), (976: 4), (1004: 4), (1005: 4), (1022: 2), (1050: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 38 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
