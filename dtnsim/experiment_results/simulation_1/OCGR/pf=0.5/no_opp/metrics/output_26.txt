The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
166(10 to 6), 170(1 to 11), 175(1 to 6), 176(5 to 10), 181(4 to 1), 183(9 to 12), 190(3 to 9), 196(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(175: 25.000000), (176: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(166: 4), (170: 2), (175: 2), (176: 4), (181: 2), (183: 2), (190: 2), (196: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
