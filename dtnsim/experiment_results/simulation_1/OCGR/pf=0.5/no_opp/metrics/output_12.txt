The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
288(10 to 6), 291(1 to 11), 295(1 to 6), 296(5 to 10), 301(4 to 1), 304(9 to 12), 310(3 to 9), 316(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(288: 3), (291: 4), (295: 3), (296: 2), (301: 1), (304: 1), (310: 2), (316: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 291: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
