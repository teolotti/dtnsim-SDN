The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
66(10 to 6), 69(1 to 11), 73(1 to 6), 74(5 to 10), 77(4 to 1), 78(9 to 12), 86(3 to 9), 89(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(66: 3), (69: 2), (73: 1), (74: 4), (77: 1), (78: 3), (86: 2), (89: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
