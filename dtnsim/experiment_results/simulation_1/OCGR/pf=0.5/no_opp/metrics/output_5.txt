The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
68(10 to 6), 70(1 to 11), 76(1 to 6), 77(5 to 10), 80(4 to 1), 84(9 to 12), 90(3 to 9), 94(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall 0 (0/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(68: 5), (70: 4), (76: 3), (77: 1), (80: 1), (84: 1), (90: 2), (94: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 70: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
