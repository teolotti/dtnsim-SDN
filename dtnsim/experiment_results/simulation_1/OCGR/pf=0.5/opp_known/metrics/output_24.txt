The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1382(10 to 6), 1387(1 to 11), 1391(1 to 6), 1392(5 to 10), 1408(4 to 1), 1409(9 to 12), 1415(3 to 9), 1439(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1409: 55.000000), (1415: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1382: 5), (1387: 2), (1391: 1), (1392: 4), (1408: 3), (1409: 4), (1415: 4), (1439: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 30 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
