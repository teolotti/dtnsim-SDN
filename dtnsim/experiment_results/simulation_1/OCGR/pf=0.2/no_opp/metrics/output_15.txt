The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
79(10 to 6), 82(1 to 11), 87(1 to 6), 88(5 to 10), 93(4 to 1), 96(9 to 12), 107(3 to 9), 117(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(87: 25.000000), (93: 60.000000), (96: 55.000000), (107: 65.000000), (117: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(79: 1), (82: 4), (87: 2), (88: 1), (93: 4), (96: 4), (107: 4), (117: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 25 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
