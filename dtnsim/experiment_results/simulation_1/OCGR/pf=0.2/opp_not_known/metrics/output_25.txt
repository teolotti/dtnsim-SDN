The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
225(10 to 6), 243(1 to 11), 249(1 to 6), 250(5 to 10), 278(4 to 1), 279(9 to 12), 303(3 to 9), 336(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(225: 55.000000), (250: 35.000000), (278: 140.000000), (336: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(225: 4), (243: 2), (249: 1), (250: 3), (278: 6), (279: 4), (303: 2), (336: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
