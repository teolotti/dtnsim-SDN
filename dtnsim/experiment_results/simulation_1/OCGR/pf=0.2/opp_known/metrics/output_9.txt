The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1524(10 to 6), 1528(1 to 11), 1534(1 to 6), 1535(5 to 10), 1553(4 to 1), 1557(9 to 12), 1569(3 to 9), 1590(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1524: 45.000000), (1535: 35.000000), (1553: 140.000000), (1557: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1524: 4), (1528: 2), (1534: 1), (1535: 7), (1553: 6), (1557: 3), (1569: 2), (1590: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 31 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
