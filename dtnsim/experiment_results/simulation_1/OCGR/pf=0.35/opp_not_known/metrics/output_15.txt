The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
215(10 to 6), 230(1 to 11), 234(1 to 6), 235(5 to 10), 265(4 to 1), 271(9 to 12), 287(3 to 9), 317(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(234: 15.000000), (265: 60.000000), (271: 55.000000), (287: 65.000000), (317: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.625 (5/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(215: 1), (230: 3), (234: 3), (235: 5), (265: 4), (271: 4), (287: 5), (317: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
