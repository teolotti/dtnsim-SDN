The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
204(10 to 6), 209(1 to 11), 215(1 to 6), 216(5 to 10), 220(4 to 1), 223(9 to 12), 231(3 to 9), 242(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(204: 45.000000), (223: 55.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(204: 4), (209: 2), (215: 1), (216: 1), (220: 3), (223: 4), (231: 4), (242: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
