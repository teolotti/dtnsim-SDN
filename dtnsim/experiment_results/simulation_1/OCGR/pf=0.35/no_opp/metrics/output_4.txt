The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
564(10 to 6), 570(1 to 11), 575(1 to 6), 576(5 to 10), 580(4 to 1), 582(9 to 12), 594(3 to 9), 603(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(564: 105.000000), (570: 35.000000), (575: 25.000000), (580: 60.000000), (582: 55.000000), (594: 65.000000), (603: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.875 (7/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(564: 5), (570: 3), (575: 2), (576: 1), (580: 4), (582: 4), (594: 4), (603: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 26 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
