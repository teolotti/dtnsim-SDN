The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
447(10 to 6), 451(1 to 11), 456(1 to 6), 457(5 to 10), 461(4 to 1), 464(9 to 12), 471(3 to 9), 475(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(456: 25.000000), (471: 65.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.25 (2/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(447: 3), (451: 3), (456: 2), (457: 1), (461: 1), (464: 1), (471: 5), (475: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 451: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), (to: 3, time: 50.000000),
