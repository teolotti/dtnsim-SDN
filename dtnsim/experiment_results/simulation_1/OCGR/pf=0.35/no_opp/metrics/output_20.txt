The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
79(10 to 6), 85(1 to 11), 94(1 to 6), 95(5 to 10), 101(4 to 1), 105(9 to 12), 114(3 to 9), 120(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(79: 45.000000), (85: 35.000000), (94: 65.000000), (95: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.5 (4/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(79: 4), (85: 3), (94: 3), (95: 3), (101: 1), (105: 2), (114: 2), (120: 2), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 24 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken:
