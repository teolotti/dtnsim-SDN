The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
74(10 to 6), 80(1 to 11), 86(1 to 6), 87(5 to 10), 90(4 to 1), 93(9 to 12), 99(3 to 9), 103(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(86: 25.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.125 (1/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(74: 5), (80: 2), (86: 2), (87: 1), (90: 1), (93: 1), (99: 3), (103: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 23 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1:
