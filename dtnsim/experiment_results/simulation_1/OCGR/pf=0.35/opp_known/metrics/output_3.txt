The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
1150(10 to 6), 1154(1 to 11), 1159(1 to 6), 1160(5 to 10), 1178(4 to 1), 1183(9 to 12), 1192(3 to 9), 1215(12 to 1), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(1159: 15.000000), (1183: 0.000000), (1192: 15.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.375 (3/8) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(1150: 3), (1154: 4), (1159: 3), (1160: 4), (1178: 4), (1183: 3), (1192: 6), (1215: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 33 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
